#collection 
Environment pickup is a collection method that happens in specific localities depending about the type. In general, environment pickup represents resources that are just _lying about_. It is one of two collection methods requiring no tools, as it is just picking up things lying on the ground. 

The only reason it is separated from the other no-tool collection method is because that's a _food harvesting_ method that requires unique skills


[[Stick]] is a raw resource found around trees and is sometimes generalised as people just breaking bits from living trees with their hands

[[Straw]] as environment pickup is just people grabbing fibrous straws and sticks too thin to be used for stick stuff. 

[[Stone]] can be found on the ground pretty much anywhere, but there are specific rock beaches or riverbeds that might collect more rocks

[[Water]] can be taken directly from wells or some body of water
