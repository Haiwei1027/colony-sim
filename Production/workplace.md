assume a rimworld-like experience

Towns are in "areas" which are either automatically allocated or player-created. 

Within colonies, "pawns" live their lives. They have a particular set of proficiencies and a job. Pawns will do their job following a routine generated for them.

"companies" are entities with a manager and workers. A manager pawn will set the routine for the pawns, making them work on specific hours.

"workplaces" describe the actual job-places the workers go to when they are to work. They do not require a company, and pawns can self-sort or be assigned to them freely.

There are generally two types of "workplace": 
 - Rural workplaces don't need to be in a town but might benefit from being close to where pawns live, get food, and socialise.
 - Urban workplaces need to be in a town

Generally, rural workplaces create raw resource and urban workplaces process them.

Later in the game, as factories historically moved out of urban areas, places that process materials will turn into "rural" workplaces. I'm not sure if these could be considered their own "town" entity, if it is it should be considered an "industrial park", but for all intents and purposes they serve the same function as rural workplaces.

# Rural Workplaces

## Farm
The most common rural workplace that almost by necessity has to be far from where people live is a farm. 
Farms have a central hub building (a _barn_), and several large fields. The yield of these fields will increase throughout history
Pawns that work on farms will spend their time tilling, sowing, and reaping crops. 

## Forestry
Forestries are another common rural workplace. A section of "forest" is allocated, and a management building created. 
Pawns who work at a forestry will perform simple maintenance tasks or not be hired at all until the trees have sufficiently grown, at which point they will be cut down and turned into timber, which can be processed into several different materials.

## Colliery
Collieries are rural workplaces, however they will benefit from being close to or in a town. 
Collieries in general are concerned with collecting coal.
