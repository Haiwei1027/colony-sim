Firing in a Kiln. In general, placing the object into the kiln and heating it up to a good temperature.

The effectiveness of firing depends highly on the type of kiln and fuel used. Many older kilns can't reach optimal firing temperatures, but in general lower temperatures are fine and just take longer.
