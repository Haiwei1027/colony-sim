#production #neolithic 
A intermediary processing method that separates [[Straw]] and [[Cereal Grain]] from [[Cereal Straw]]. 

Originating with the first cereal farms, hand-threshing as a production method remained relevant until its mechanisation during the industrial agricultural revolution. About one-quarter of agricultural labour was devoted to it.
