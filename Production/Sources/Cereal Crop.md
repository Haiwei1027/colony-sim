A cereal crop is a specific crop type producing cereal grains when harvested. In an implementation of the model, cereal crops can be de-generalised into its constituent members, which are in general:
- Millet
- Rice
- Barley
- Sorghum
- Maize
- Oats
- Wheat
- Rye


There's a few different ways to harvest cereal crops like [[Crop Picking]] which is physically going around every plant and removing the cereal grains directly from the plant, and [[Reaping]] which just gets the whole plant.
