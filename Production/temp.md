All production happens with the end-goal of increasing human comfort
There are elements of discomfort in our lives that have become evolutionarily advantageous to find uncomfortable. These evolutionary discomforts are overwhelmingly based in material reality. Through production, we create things that alleviate these discomforts, creating comfort.

We can classify this production into distinct end-results.

- Housing: a living space for individuals or social groups, typically with provisions and privacy
- Furniture: we have a sense of beauty, and this beauty overlaps with utility. Furniture serves comfort directly.
- Warmth: Ever since the creation of fire, warming up has become relatively trivial. But the methods of this heat have changed rapidly, making heating easier and cheaper.
- Food: Food is a basic need. Its production has evolved to make getting tasty food easier.
- Water: Water is another basic need and has been fairly easily met throughout the years. Its streamlining to safe flowing water through pipes represents the ultimate evolution of water production.
- Clothing: The need to protect our bodies, regulate temperature, and look good. 
- Social: People often forget that humans are biologically social. Socialising is a need, and without it people often suffer.
- Art: Some method of self-expression, often taking forms within production especially furniture.
- Movement: The ability to get around and see the world seems something else crucial to human living. The infrastructure that serves production also often serves transportation, which in turn serves social interaction
