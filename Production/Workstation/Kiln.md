A type of oven designed for more industrial processes than cooking ovens. They range in construction from brick kilns and rock kilns to modern ceramic kilns and industrial metal kilns.

As a construction, they aren't really represented by a production method. In the neolithic game, they would be made from [[Stone]] but later [[Brick]] constructions became popular.
