The ground is the crudest of workspaces. Often littered with grass, dirt, sand, it can be easy to lose track of your things. Not only does it lack a clean surface, but it's a handcrafting workstation that isn't even elevated! You have to _crouch down_ to use the ground.

Anything that can be done on the ground can be done on a bench or a table more effectively, but the base-case workstation is _the ground_.

The ground is the only workstation that doesn't need to be made.
