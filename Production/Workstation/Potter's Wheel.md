Like a table or something. It spins, and when you put clay on it you can relatively easily shape the clay as it spins into a pot or something else radially symmetric. 

They come in a few different types. 

The simplest build is just a shaped rock you put on the ground and spin. Built from [[Stone]] and shaped with [[Pickaxe]]

Can also just be made a a piece of furniture out of [[Wood]] and presumably building tools but I haven't added those to the production yet.
