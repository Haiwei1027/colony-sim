#resource
A cereal grain is a product harvested from usually genetically cultivated bread. It comes in a few different types:
- Millet
- Rice
- Barley
- Sorghum
- Maize
- Oats
- Wheat
- Rye

In general, all of these grains can be used for the same things. However, an implementation of this model should still store the distinction because some cannot be used for the general cereal grain methods. Some also have unique methods

For example, Rice, Maize, and Oats can't be used for bread. Rice is also a unique staple food that in general can be used for anything a cereal grain can be used for (apart from bread).
