Iron ores come in a bunch of different forms.

_oxides_ are the most common for smelting
- Hematite $Fe_2O_3$
- Magnetite $Fe_3O_4$
- Goethite $FeO(OH)$
- Limonite $FeO(OH)\cdot n(H_2O)$

_sulphides_ are less common for smelting but make good fire starters and sparks
- Pyrite $FeS_2$
- Marcasite $FeS_2$ (crystal structure)

And there's also Siderite $FeCO_3$ which is not very good because of iron content
