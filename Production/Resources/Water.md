#resource
Water. H2O with lots of other things mixed in. Water as a raw resource is undrinkable but assumed free of the largest particles and animals. It's useful in production and _can_ be purified into drinkable water. This specific water is fresh. 

Water needs a container to be moved in any significant quantity. Movement of water without a container is assumed to be done using hands, something else on the immediate person, or like a leaf or something. 

Bladder is the easiest water container. It's a raw resource!
